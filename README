1. run get_meta.pl

2. patch:

  after you run get_meta.pl, run this in the manifests directory:

    for i in *.patch; do patch -p0 --dry-run < $i; done

3. set up the database
  * databse name: 'ninenine'
  * user: 'sherlock'
  * password 'somepassword'
  This user should have full ctonrol of the ninenine database

4. Run the DDL
  pql -U sherlock ninenine -f ./etc/ddl.sql

5. import the metadata

  keep fingers crossed for no errors
  This takes a long time. Would be nice to speed this up...
